"Welcome To Botania" "welcome"
#<<EOF
Welcome to Botania! I congratulate you on the fine decision to strap a sapling and a book together. Or just on finding this tome in a chest. Whichever applies.
You can navigate this book with the arrows at the bottom of this page, or scroll through pages with your mouse wheel.

Despite its appearance, Botania is in essence a "tech mod": it requires you to put to use ingenuity, thought, and redstone to create and progress. Keep that in mind.
Of course, you'll also be rewarded with cool toys, blocks, and equipment along the way.

Botania is a mod for anybody who likes to play Minecraft because they like building cool things. It is designed to be fully playable standalone, but can also be played with other mods.
With a few exceptions, everything in this mod can be fully automated with only Minecraft and itself.

If you happen to find yourself feeling lost, try checking out the mod's Advancements or Challenges, both of which can be found on the left-hand side of this book's main page.
The book is laid out in a user-friendly way with a fair number of helpful features, so before you jump in and start playing, take a bit of time to familiarize yourself with those.

The "Entry Index" category is helpful for searching for a particular entry, as it contains every entry in the book in one place.

And that's it for this introduction! I hope you enjoy playing with Botania as much as I enjoyed making it!
~Vazkii, the mod author

"Garden of Glass" "gardenOfGlass"
#<<EOF
In the Garden of Glass nobody can hear you scream.
You're alone in space.
How exciting.

The Garden of Glass is a skyblock mode for Botania. It's aimed more at players who have some experience in the mod, but if you're new to it, you're more than welcome to try it out anyway.
Most of Botania functions the same as it does on the ground, but some tweaks have been put in place to allow for skyblock-style gameplay, which are listed in the following pages.

After spawning in the Garden of Glass, you'll find Living Roots under your feet. These can be crafted into Saplings and Floral Fertilizer, or just used as Bone Meal. Sneak-right clicking a Dirt or Grass block with an empty hand will rummage through the soil, yielding some Pebbles; these can be converted into Cobblestone. Filling a Petal Apothecary can be done with a Bowl, which in turn can be filled by right-clicking it on a water block.

Creating Floral Fertilizer

Aside from that, some things in Botania have been changed to fit Skyblock gameplay: The Orechid is easier to make, faster, and much more Mana-efficient; The Cocoon of Caprice and the Mana Spreader have simpler recipes; the Blaze Mesh, which can be purified into Obsidian, is made from powder instead of rods; melon and pumpkin seeds can drop from tall grass; floral fertilizer yields more per craft; and certain additional recipes have been added.

Entering the Nether might seem difficult under these conditions-- worry not, however, as Blaze Meshes (as mentioned previously) can be converted into Obsidian. To get these lamps, spawn Blazes from Fel Pumpkins.
Since there's no easily accessible Flint on an island in space, a Fire Charge will have to do for portal-opening.

The Mana Flash present in the starting area will allow a player without a Lexica Botania to exchange a Sapling for one, by right-clicking the Sapling on the Mana Flash.

"Lexica Botania" "lexicon"
#<<EOF
The Lexica Botania is the repository of all knowledge for all botanical matters. (But you probably knew that already.)
All well-known botanical knowledge is stored within these pages. For convenience, if a block happens to have an entry in here, it can be sneak-right clicked on with the Lexica Botania to open said entry.

Any entries typed in Italics are basic entries, which contain the core knowledge required to play Botania-- you may want to read those first. Most sections contain one or more of these entries, so a good look through those would be a good idea.

The Lexica Botania's title can also be customized by placing it in an Anvil and renaming it. This changes both its cover and its title.
The Edition of the Lexica shown equates to the version of the Botania you're running (and no, I don't care about the fourth wall).

"Mystical Flowers" "flowers"
#<<EOF
Around the world, you may stumble upon a large variety of Mystical Flowers. Spotting these flowers doesn't take much work, as they glow faintly and sparkle.
They come in a total of 16 different colors.
These flowers can also be grown with Floral Fertilizer (read on).

These flowers can be plucked for Mystical Petals, which are used in the creation of magical instruments and plants.
Right-clicking a petal upon the ground will bury it, making it emit particles.
These petals can also be crushed into the corresponding Dyes.

By mixing Dye with some Bone Meal, you'll create a different type of fertilizer. This Floral Fertilizer will grow a few Mystical Flowers in the nearby vicinity, if you ever run low on those.

Using any combination of typical flower substances will work

There're also some taller variants of the typical Mystical Flowers around the world. These can only be gathered with Shears, but can be plucked for twice the petals a normal flower would yield. They're a bit too big for dye, though.

Tall flower variants can be made manually by fertilizing a Mystical Flower or a Buried Petal with Bone Meal.
If you find yourself running low on a particular color, try burying a petal of that color and using Bone Meal on it.

"Petal Apothecary" "apothecary"
#<<EOF
To create plant life that can do their bidding, a botanist needs a special means of infusing plants with mystical energy.
Luckily, the Petal Apothecary can do just that.

This block, when placed in the world and given some water (by right-clicking or throwing in a Water Bucket), will accept any Mystical Petals thrown into it, absorbing their energies.
Once the correct petals have been provided, throwing any Seeds in will finalize the crafting process.

All Functional and Generating Flora are made here (for more information, read through the respective sections in this lexicon).
Sneak-right clicking the Petal Apothecary with an empty hand will remove the last item thrown in.

If it's filled with Lava instead of Water, the Apothecary will serve as a brazier and incinerator, destroying any items that come into contact with it.
Tossing Vines into a cobblestone Apothecary will give it an overgrown appearance.

Comparators can detect an Apothecary's fullness.
Since the Petal Apothecary can be filled by with a dropped Water Bucket, and Dispensers can fill buckets, creating a system that automatically refills the water in the block shouldn't prove too difficult.

A simple tip for the more efficiency-minded: Up to twenty seconds after crafting a flower and after refilling the water, if you right-click the apothecary with an empty hand, it'll pull another set of the same ingredients out of your inventory, for quick crafting in bulk.

"Pure Daisy" "pureDaisy"
#<<EOF
Far from being just the most basic, the Pure Daisy is the most important flower a botanist can have.
This flower will purify any adjacent Wood and Stone blocks (as seen on the next page) into their purified counterparts, Livingwood and Livingrock. These resources are important crafting materials throughout a botanist's career.

A few other blocks can also be purified by placing them around the flower. While not as unique and essential as the living blocks, these recipes still can come in handy: Netherrack purifies into Cobblestone, Soul Sand into Sand, Ice into Packed Ice, and Water into Snow.

"Wand of the Forest" "wand"
#<<EOF
A botanist's most important tool for manipulating flowers is the Wand of the Forest.
This wand, crafted from a pair of Mystical Petals strapped to a few Livingwood Twigs, is a must-have for a huge number of botanical tasks.

The wand has two modes, Bind Mode and Function Mode. In Bind Mode, sneak-right click it on a compatible block to select it, then sneak-right click elsewhere to bind the two blocks. In Function Mode it simply doesn't perform this function, freeing the sneak-right click action up for other tasks.
The two modes can be switched between by sneak-right clicking the wand in the air.

Sneak-right clicking a block in Function Mode rotates the block around the axis of the side it was clicked on-- for example, using the wand on the top of a Chest will change the direction it faces. Most blocks with orientations can be reoriented this way.
A Dispenser holding a wand will use the wand on the block it currently faces, when triggered.

(
"Runic Altar" "runeAltar"
#<<EOF
Runic creation is a complex topic, but an important one for the advancement of any botanist's career. However, this mode of crafting requires a firm grasp on the concepts of Mana Manipulation to use. Before proceeding further, a read through the important entries (those in Italics) in that section of the Lexica Botania might prove helpful.

Runes are vital components of complex magical devices or flora, created on a Runic Altar.
To use a Runic Altar, start by placing (via either a right-click or a simple toss) the components of the rune you want to create upon the altar.

Point a Mana Spreader with a supply of Mana at the altar, and let the Mana flow.
Your wand will show you the progress of the transfer; it should be apparent when the altar has received enough Mana. When that happens, just drop or right-click a piece of Livingrock upon the altar, then use the wand on it to collect your rune.

A total of 16 Runes exist.
The most elementary runes are named after the Four Elements, the intermediate runes are named after the Four Seasons, and the most advanced runes are named after the Seven Deadly Sins. A separate Rune of Mana also exists outside this progression.

Sneak-right clicking the Runic Altar with an empty hand while it's not accepting mana will pull out the last item input.
Additionally, an attached Comparator will emit signal strength 1 if the altar is accepting Mana, and signal strength 2 if it's ready to craft the rune.

Any runes used for recipes in the Runic Altar function as catalysts, and will be returned upon completion of the runic recipe.
Similarly to the Petal Apothecary, right-clicking this block with an empty hand after a recipe is complete will pull another set of the items used for the last recipe, for faster crafting in bulk.

"Terrasteel" "terrasteel"
#<<EOF
Terrasteel is a complex and useful magical alloy, infused with ridiculous amounts of Mana. Synthesizing it proves to be no small task. For starters, its creation requires a Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate placed over a checkerboard pattern of Lapis Lazuli Blocks and Livingrock (or Shimmerrock). This block then needs to be provided with Mana, with Sparks being the most efficient mode of transfer.

After a plate is set up and ready to receive Mana, tossing one Manasteel Ingot, Mana Diamond and Mana Pearl each upon the plate will begin the infusion.
Picking up any of the items will halt the infusion, causing severe Mana Loss (all mana transferred to the plate is lost). The infusion uses about half a Mana Pool's worth of Mana to create a single piece of Terrasteel; multiple Sparks passing it Mana will accelerate the process.

An elusive flower by the name of the Black Lotus exists; however, it is not known to grow or reproduce. There are no known sources of the Lotus at this time.
It is known, however, that each bloom contains a good deal of concentrated Mana that can be released by dissolving it inside a non-empty Mana Pool. Just throwing it in will do.

"Flower Pouch" "flowerBag"
#<<EOF
The physical laws regarding Inventories are somewhat skewed in our world. Thanks to that, carrying an array of different colors of flowers can turn out to be a major hassle. Luckily, a Flower Pouch takes care of all those issues. It can store up to one stack of each color of Mystical Flower, and passively catch any more that its holder picks up.

Flowers won't be picked up by the pouch if the pouch is held in your dominant hand.
Furthermore, sneak-right clicking the pouch on a Chest or other inventory will dump all flowers the pouch contains into said inventory.

It's about the same size on the inside (any colors work)

"Introduction to Mana" "mIntro"
#<<EOF
Mana is an ethereal substance-- in essence, it's a mystical form of energy. Its existence is inconsistent to the senses, and its color depends on its surrounding environment.
The manipulation of Mana is likely the most important skill a botanist needs to master.

Generating Flora are used to create Mana (read the corresponding section for more details). Mana so generated can be extracted and transferred with Mana Spreaders and stored in Mana Pools. Mana can be used for a myriad of things: for starters, it can fuel Functional Flora (read that section too).

To get started on mastering Mana, learn to use Endoflames or Hydroangeas, Mana Spreaders, and Mana Pools.
These form a basic infrastructure for mana generation; have a read through the Functional Flora and Natural Apparatus sections of this Lexicon for more details.
EOF
)

(
"Mana Spreader" "spreader"
#<<EOF
The Mana Spreader is the single most important tool a botanist needs to manipulate Mana.
This block shoots Mana from point A to point B. It faces a cardinal direction when placed, but sneak-right clicking it with a Wand of the Forest on a face points it elsewhere. It can be aimed at other blocks with a wand in Bind Mode.

The Mana Spreader, as seen with a Wand of the Forest held

The Mana Spreader has a small internal buffer of Mana, which will get filled by Generating Flora bound to it. (Flowers, when placed, auto-bind to the nearest spreader.) This buffer can be viewed by hovering over the Spreader with a Wand of the Forest in hand.

Holding a Wand of the Forest makes nearby spreaders display aiming beams. Hovering over a spreader highlights its target. The sparkles show where Mana Loss begins to occur.
As long as the target of the spreader can accept Mana (that is, can contain Mana and isn't full), the spreader will repeatedly fire Mana Bursts, which travel to their destination and transfer their Mana to it.

The spreader will only fire another burst when the last one hits its target.
Furthermore, a Mana Burst will start suffering Mana Loss after a small amount of time: this can be seen in the burst's appearance, as it thins at that point.

Applying a Redstone Signal to a spreader will pause its firing of bursts. If finer control is required, a Pulse Mana Spreader is recommended, as it fires upon a redstone signal in lieu of a target.

Right-clicking the spreader with a piece of Wool will sleeve it. In addition to making the spreader look fancier, it'll also muffle the sound when a burst is shot, reducing the potential noise of a large number of spreaders in one area.
Right-clicking with an empty hand will remove the sleeve.
EOF
)

(
"Mana Pool" "pool"
#<<EOF
The Mana Pool is, simply put, a storage for Mana.
It accepts mana from Mana Spreaders, and any adjacent ones will fill from it automatically.
All Functional Flora require a nearby Mana Pool to draw power from.

Mana Pools come in two types: a weaker, Diluted variety which stores a very small amount of Mana, and a Normal variety, which stores a hundred times more than the diluted kind.
Whenever "Mana Pool" is referred to elsewhere, it refers to a normal one.

The Diluted Mana Pool can be useful as a small buffer for a flower or system that doesn't use much Mana, as a normal pool holds a lot of it. Thanks to that, Mana readings for a normal pool won't be very precise: due to its scale, the displayed bar's size on a normal pool will increase very slowly.

Tossing certain resources into a Mana Pool will infuse them with Mana from the pool, turning them into more magically-useful forms, like Manasteel Ingots or Mana Pearls.
A Wand of the Forest can read the Mana levels in a pool, much like a Mana Spreader. A Redstone Comparator can also output a signal based on percentage full.

Manasteel Ingots can be crafted into blocks or nuggets through the usual recipes.
Right-clicking with any color of Dye on a pool will have give the pool its color, for decoration or easier labelling.

"Sparks" "sparks"
#<<EOF
Sparks are interesting things. Created from a combination of raw energy and Mana, they can be placed only on a few specific Mana-containing or -accepting blocks (notably Mana Pools).
Certain blocks have the ability to harness Mana from Sparks, but as of now their uses are sparse.

Placing a Spark over a Mana Pool and another over a nearby block that can accept it will allow the latter to access the former's reserves on demand.
To remove a Spark, simply sneak-right click it with a Wand of the Forest. Regular right-clicking will show which other Sparks this one can transfer to.

Sparks can be dyed with Dye; sparks with different colors will never interact. They can also be splashed with a bit of Phantom Ink to make them highly translucent (in case you think they look too obtrusive).
EOF

(
"Spark Augments" "sparkUpgrades"
#<<EOF
Sparks seem to be more versatile than previously believed: a variety of Augments can be applied to them, enhancing their abilities. Augments can only be applied to Sparks that lie on Mana Pools, and a Spark can only have a single Augment at any given time.

The Dispersive Augment allows a Spark to drain the Mana in its pool to charge nearby players' Mana-containing items.

The Dominant Augment makes a Spark pull Mana from nearby non-augmented Sparks' pools into its own, until the latter is full.

The Recessive Augment makes a Spark distribute all of the Mana in its pool into any nearby non-augmented or Dispersive Sparks' pools, until its own is completely empty.

Finally, the Isolated Augment prevents a Spark from interacting with any Dominant or Recessive Sparks, but still allows it to interact with blocks that can receive their Mana from the Spark network.

"Mana Splitter" "distributor"

"Mana Void" "manaVoid"
#<<EOF
The Mana Void is, in layman's terms, a grave for Mana. Any Mana poured into this block will simply vanish into the void, never to be seen again.

(
"Mana Lenses" "lens"
#<<EOF
A Mana Spreader can be upgraded with Mana Lenses. The most basic Mana Lens does absolutely nothing.
A Lens can be dyed by crafting it with any color of dye to give it that color, or with a Mana Pearl to create a Rainbow Lens. These change the color of the fired burst.

But lenses aren't just for fancy colors-- they can be upgraded with all sorts of materials to create all sorts of effects with their Mana Bursts.
Keep in mind that a normal Mana Spreader must point at a Mana-receiving block to fire. A Pulse Mana Spreader is recommended for certain lenses instead.
Blocks like Hoppers can add or remove spreaders' lenses.

Sometimes, though, having a single Mana Lens on a spreader just isn't enough. Combining two lenses with a Slimeball in a crafting table will unite them into one lens with the effects of both.
The first lens used determines the look and color of the resultant lens. Note that some combinations will not work, and that you can't combine two lenses of the same type.

The Velocity Lens will dramatically increase the speed at which a Mana Burst travels, but at the expense of initial capacity and faster Mana Loss.

The Potency Lens will double the amount of Mana a Mana Burst can carry; however, the beam travels slower, and after it starts to lose mana, does so at a much faster rate.

The Resistance Lens will significantly increase the amount of time a Mana Burst can go without starting to lose Mana, but slows it as well.

The Efficiency Lens will decrease the amount of time it takes for a Mana Burst to start losing its Mana, but will also decrease its rate of loss.

The Bounce Lens will allow a Mana Burst to bounce off walls, rather than dissipating on collision.

The Messenger Lens greatly decreases the amount of Mana a Mana Burst carries and dramatically increases the burst's speed and maximum distance.
This can be very useful for interactions with blocks such as the Mana Detector, Drum of the Wild, or Animated Torch.

The Gravity Lens makes gravity affect a Mana Burst, making the burst move in an arc. As compensation, it also slightly increases the time before Mana Loss sets in.

The Bore Lens charges a Mana Burst with the ability to use its own Mana to break any blocks it hits.

The Damaging Lens allows a Mana Burst to use its own mana to damage any living beings it hits.

The Phantom Lens is an interesting one. By leveraging the Abstruse Platform's properties, the lens allows a Mana Burst to pass through blocks. In doing so, the time it can survive without losing mana is decreased.

The Magnetizing Lens (as its name states) allows a Mana Burst to home in (or "magnetize") on any nearby blocks that can receive Mana. Doing so slightly decreases the speed of the burst.

The Entropic Lens imbues a Mana Burst with entropic forces, causing it to release its energy in the form of an explosion when it collides against something that can't receive Mana.

The Influence Lens allows a Mana Burst to have influence over any nearby dropped items, experience orbs and even falling blocks, having them move in the exact same vector of motion as the burst itself.

The Weight Lens places a strong downward force within a Mana Burst, making any block hit by it (as long as it has space below) fall like Sand and Gravel do.

The Kindle Lens is infused with a burning spark. When a Mana Burst fired through it hits a block, the block will catch fire. It doesn't seem to ignite living beings, though.
It has the ability to both ignite and close Nether Portals, but to close them it needs to be aimed at the frame, lest the burst it carries end up going through the portal.

The Force Lens acts as a Piston. When a Mana Burst fired through it hits a block that a piston can move, it'll do just that.

The Flash Lens creates a flame on a block, of the same color as the burst that caused it. The flame provides light and is purely decorative.
If a burst hits one of these flames, it puts the flame out instead.

"Mana Tablet" "manaTablet"

Using Mana Spreaders to transport Mana is all well and good, but there are other ways of getting the stuff around too.
The Mana Tablet is a portable item that can carry Mana within itself.
In addition, other items in an inventory can draw from it for their own use, making it an essential tool.

Tossing a tablet into a Mana Pool will allow for flow of Mana between them.
Sneak-right clicking (or using a Dispenser) on the Mana Pool with a Wand of the Forest will change which way the Mana will flow.
Unlike normal items, dropped tablets never despawn.

"Manastar" "manastar"

"Elven Mana Spreaders" "dreamwoodSpreader"
#<<EOF
When it comes right down to it, Dreamwood simply conducts Mana better than Livingwood. A few adjustments in recipe (like substituting Elementium for Gold) yield an Elven Mana Spreader, which conducts more Mana, faster, and for longer without Mana Loss.
Unfortunately, these can't be turned into Pulse Mana Spreaders.

Combining this already-powerful spreader with a Gaia Spirit and a Dragonstone gem yields an even more potent variant. The Gaia Spreader is the gold standard of Mana Spreaders, with upgrades pretty much all around.
Do note that these spreaders fire larger payloads at once (and thus might fire less often).
EOF

(
"Elven Mana Lenses" "elvenLenses"
#<<EOF
The knowledge of Alfheim's Mana-handling methods comes, of course, with an array of new and useful Mana Lenses.
Unlike common overworld-y lenses, these are a bit more distinctive in their uses...

First off, the Paintslinger Lens. This lens needs to be dyed one of the 16 colors of the spectrum to function. When a burst that's passed through it hits a colorable block (Wool, Stained Clay or Glass...), it'll turn that block (and any connected blocks of the same type and color) into the color of the Mana Burst. It seems to work on Sheep too.

The Warp Lens is an interesting one. A burst under its effects that collides with a Force Relay will teleport to the target of said Force Relay, maintaining its momentum, but making its Mana irrecoverable.
Furthermore, when it's combined with a Bore Lens (the Bore Lens must be first), it'll prevent bursts from breaking Force Relays or Pistons, and teleport any blocks broken by the Bore Lens to the burst's origin.

The Redirective Lens will only take effect when fired from a Mana Spreader. Any burst under its effects that collides with a Mana Spreader will (apart from transferring Mana like normal) make the receiving spreader point towards the one that fired the burst.

The Celebratory Lens functions much like the common Entropic Lens; however, instead of an explosion, it creates a festive firework dyed the color of the burst.

The Flare Lens takes over a Mana Spreader's functionality, preventing it from firing any bursts. This type of lens is called a Control Lens.
The effect of this particular Control Lens is to make the spreader fire a continuous particle burst of the color the lens is dyed, in the direction the spreader is aimed. No mana is consumed; there're surely plenty of decorative uses for this.

The Tripwire Lens is another Control Lens.
A spreader with it attached will only be allowed to fire if the burst would hit a mob or player.
EOF
)

(
"Mana Prism" "prism"
#<<EOF
Mana Lenses manipulate Mana Bursts to provide certain powers. The Mana Prism extends this functionality to switch a burst's lens effects on the fly.
With a Spectral Platform as a component, this block does not have a physical presence; entities and bursts can pass through it as if it weren't there.

Right-clicking a prism with any variety of Mana Lens places the lens in the prism. Whenever a Mana Burst passes through the prism, its color and effect will be set to that of the lens in the prism (if the lens is not dyed, the burst will turn white).
Using any of the four basic lenses in the prism will also increase the time before the burst starts losing Mana, allowing it to go further.
EOF

(
"Mana on Rails" "poolCart"
#<<EOF
What could be an easier way to transport Mana over large distances than attaching a Mana Pool to a Minecart? It's simple! Similar to other types of carts in most respects, a Minecart with Mana Pool can store and transport, well, Mana. On rails.
Breaking a cart with any Mana in it will lose all contained Mana, so be careful.

Transferring Mana between a cart and a pool is done with a Mana Pump. These can face in any of the four cardinal directions, and will transfer Mana between an adjacent pool and a cart-with-pool on the opposite side.
The transfer rate is extremely fast due to the mechanical nature of the pump-- so fast that overflow is possible, which can cause up to a whole diluted pools' worth of Mana Loss.

Mana will flow from the blue side of the pump in the direction of the arrow.
The pump can be turned off with a redstone signal, and an attached Comparator will measure the amount of Mana in the cart.
Lastly, a pool on a cart serves purely for transport, and can not receive, send, transfer, or infuse any items with its Mana.

The Spark Tinkerer is a block with the ability to modify the Augments placed on Sparks. Placing one adjacent to a Mana Pool (or other block with a Spark attached) will connect it to that block.
Right-clicking the Spark Tinkerer with a Spark Augment will put the augment in the block; the augment can be removed by right-clicking again.

When the Spark Tinkerer gets a redstone signal, it'll randomly pick an adjacent connected Spark with a different augment and swap the augment on that Spark with the one stored in the Tinkerer.
The stored augment can be withdrawn or deposited with Hoppers or other automation methods. Comparators can read the type of augment stored.

The Manatide Bellows increases the speed of Mana Pools' output.
Placing these bellows next to (and pointing towards) a Mana Pool will increase the speed at which the pool outputs its Mana into Mana Tablets or other items. Multiple bellows will further increase the transfer rate.

A slightly more mundane use of the Manatide Bellows is to stoke a Furnace's flames.
A Manatide Bellows can be operated manually via a right-click; pointing the bellows towards an active Furnace and manning it will increase the speed and efficiency at which the items in the Furnace get smelted.

There are myriad uses for the Mana a botanist generates, notably as the fuel for an assortment of Functional Flora.
These flowers will drain Mana from a nearby Mana Pool into themselves to perform their respective functions.
Note that flowers can't receive power directly through Mana Spreaders.

All Functional Flora, just like Generating Flora, contain a small buffer of Mana.

Flowers bind to only one Mana Pool at a time. When placed, they'll bind to the nearest pool (or the closest placed afterward, if none were in range), and should be re-bound with a wand in Bind Mode.

Additionally, some functional flowers use a Redstone Root in their creation. These flowers' effects can be toggled with redstone signals.

Many Functional Flora interact with dropped items; certain soils can ensure they do so in the right order.
Planting a flower over Podzol will add a small delay before it can interact with dropped items, allowing for a "priority" system of sorts. Planting a flower on Mycelium will create a larger delay.

This system's use also extends to Floating Flowers, via the use of Boreal Seeds and Infestation Spores.
Given two flowers with the same (or no) delay, a Generating Flower (e.g. the Endoflame) will pick up an item before a Functional one (e.g. the Hopperhock). For two flowers of the same type, it's a secret to everyone.

The Orechid is a great flower; the ability to create raw ores from Mana and Stone can be a great boon to any sedentary botanist's life. However, it can't create ores of a more Nether-y variety. Getting that sorted out is easy: Switching around a few petals will yield an Orechid Ignem, which creates Nether ores in Netherrack instead. The flower must be in the Nether dimension to work.

"Spectranthemum" "spectranthemum"
#<<EOF
Long-distance item transport can be an arduous task; at some point, water channels and Daffomills just won't cut it. The Spectranthemum uses Mana to warp the fabric of reality around any items near it, teleporting them elsewhere in the world. Note that Mana-containing and already-teleported items interfere with the warp; neither of these can be teleported.

To specify the destination of warped items, use a Wand of the Forest in Bind Mode to bind the flower to a location within 12 blocks, the same way one would to a pool. To view what block the flower is bound to (as opposed to the pool it's pulling Mana from), sneak while looking at it with a wand.

This flower is bound by the axiom of chunkloading; i.e. it won't send items to unloaded chunks. This topic, however, is beyond the scope of this lexicon.

Additionally, Horns or Drums will not break blocks within its range.

"Generating Flora" "gIntro"
#<<EOF
Generating Mana should be at the top of any botanist's priority list. Luckily, there's a wide selection of Generating Flora willing to do the job.
These flowers, as the name would imply, generate Mana, usually consuming resources to do so.

All Generating Flora, like their Functional brethren, can hold a small internal buffer of Mana.
Generating Flora will automatically output to the closest nearby Mana Spreader.

These flowers bind to one Mana Spreader at a time for Mana output. They'll bind to the nearest spreader present at the time of their placement (or the nearest placed afterward, if none were in range), and must be re-bound to another spreader with a wand in Bind Mode, if so desired.

Choosing your first Generating Flower is a pretty simple task; the simplest two choices for any fledgling botanist are the Endoflame and the Hydroangeas.
The former uses Coal or other fuel sources to generate Mana. The latter uses Water sources for the same task, but decays after about three days.
EOF
)

(
"Endoflame" "endoflame"
#<<EOF
The Endoflame is a very rudimentary generating flower; it'll absorb any combustible items or blocks dropped on the nearby vicinity, one at a time, and burn through them to generate Mana.
The amount of time it takes to burn through an item is roughly half of the time a Furnace would.

There're a few small caveats though: the Endoflame will not burn anything that leave byproducts in Furnaces (e.g. Lava Buckets, which leave Buckets behind).
Furthermore, the flower can only burn around four Block of Coals' worth of fuel at once. If any single fuel item with a longer burn time is used, its full efficiency will be lost.

As the Endoflame is often a botanist's first foray into proper automatable Generating Flora, it shouldn't be run manually forever. As the flower requires dropped items, an Open Crate (found in the Natural Apparatus section of this book) and some sort of output limiter (a timer or pressure plate) would be ideal for it.

(
"Hydroangeas" "hydroangeas"
#<<EOF
Hydroangeas flowers act as liquid-based passive generators. They suck up any still water in a 3x3 area (at the same altitude) around them, converting the water into Mana. Unfortunately, even though they seem to function faster during Rain, their base Mana throughput is still rather slow. In addition, they decay after around three days, making them nonviable for long-term Mana production.
EOF
)

(
"Thermalily" "thermalily"
#<<EOF
The Thermalily is a Lava-flavoured counterpart to the Hydroangeas. The flower absorbs Lava around it (at the same altitude) to generate Mana.
After absorbing one block of Lava, the flower will produce Mana continually for around 45 seconds, but afterwards needs a bit of time (around 5 minutes) to cool down before it can absorb more.

The Mana throughput the Thermalily produces during its active phase is extremely high; it's an ideal flower for a quick boost in stores.
However, during its "cooldown" period, any adjacent Lava will be absorbed and reset the cooldown without yielding any Mana.

While placing Lava in the world is definitely possible via Dispensers, automatically gathering it and carrying it from the Nether or deep underground is not.
As such, the Thermalily is classified as a "semi-automatable" flower.

(
"Rosa Arcana" "arcanerose"
#<<EOF
Experience Points contain a magic of their own. The Rosa Arcana can tap into this magic, absorbing the experience of nearby players and turning it into Mana.
It can also synthesize mana from experience orbs and enchanted items in the world; however, this method nets you a bit less mana for the same experience.

"Munchdew" "munchdew"
#<<EOF
Generating the form of natural energy that is Mana is best done from other living materials. The Munchdew will eat up any nearby Leaves and convert them into Mana.
However, no saplings (or any other items) will be dropped from the leaves.

This flower outputs a hefty sum of mana per tree's worth of leaves.
However, once it finishes eating all leaves in range, the Munchdew will take a brief digestive break, and will only eat again after around a minute.
EOF
)

(
"Entropinnyum" "entropinnyum"
#<<EOF
To generate a blast of Mana, in fact, a blast might be required. Igniting a block of TNT on dry land near an Entropinnyum will have the latter absorb all the entropy generated by the blast, converting it into Mana and nullifying any damage in the process. However, to absorb the explosion, the flower must not have any Mana stored in it-- otherwise, explosions as usual.

Note that the Entropinnyum has taken a liking to ethically-sourced TNT, produced by natural means. Feeding the flower unethically-sourced (for example, duplicated) TNT will incur a severe efficiency loss.
The flower's detection abilities are limited; for best results, remove all nearby rails, sticky blocks, and pistons.

"Kekimurus" "kekimurus"

Cake is delicious; everyone loves it, flowers included.
The Kekimurus is one of these Cake aficionados, and will eat any placed in its vicinity, synthesizing the enriching nutrients into sweet, sweet Mana.

(
"Gourmaryllis" "gourmaryllis"
#<<EOF
The Gourmaryllis is one hungry flower. It'll eat any food items it finds in a small area and turn them into Mana.
There's a catch, though: it can only digest a single food item at any given time, outputting Mana once it's done. It will devour any other foods while digesting, but yield no returns for those.

The amount of time it takes to digest a delicacy depends on the food's nutritional value-- in layman's terms: the number of food points it restores.
Thus, a Steak will take four seconds to digest, an Apple will take two, a loaf of Bread will take two and a half, and so on.
The rate of Mana production will also vary with nutrition: the Gourmaryllis prefers bigger foods.

For example, a single Steak will produce more Mana than two Apples, both in total and per-second.
Of course, like any proper gourmand, the Gourmaryllis loves variety in its diet; feeding it many different foods can be very rewarding. (Giving it the same food repeatedly might not go over so well, though.)
An experienced botanist can infer the Gourmaryllis' mood from the sounds it makes.

There's some unidentified power in the universe that creates Slimes at certain points, seemingly at random. Slime Chunks, they call those points. The Narslimmus is a flower that has the ability to tap into that energy; it'll absorb Slimes created by that power and collect all the Mana generated by the destruction. The larger the Slime, the more Mana is created. (It also makes a bit of a sticky mess.)

"Spectrolus" "spectrolus"
#<<EOF
The Spectrolus is a flower that's particularly fond of the various hues of Wool. It'll consume any and all Wool blocks dropped nearby, converting them to Mana.
However, it's picky as to what colors it wants. Starting from White, after it eats one piece of Wool, it'll rotate to the next color in the spectrum.

While it'll consume all Wool around it, it'll only create any mana if it gets the color it wants-- so haphazardly tossing Wool at it is wasteful at best.
The color craves at any given moment can be seen by hovering over the flower with a Wand of the Forest.

The flower is widely known to consume refined wool, but you wonder what would happen if you gave it wool straight "from the source"?...

(
"Dandelifeon" "dandelifeon"
#<<EOF
The Dandelifeon is not recommended for the faint of heart.
While it's likely the most efficient available generating flower in the botanist's toolbox, it's also one of the least straightforward to use.

This flower's function is based on a cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. The area for this procedure is a 25x25 square, centered around the Dandelifeon itself.
As long as the flower receives a redstone signal, it'll step the automaton twice a second.

Each location within the flower's 25x25 area of effect counts as a Cell. Cells may be alive or dead; a cell counts as alive if its respective block is a Cellular Block (read on), or dead if it's anything else. The Neighbors of a cell are the eight cells surrounding any cell.

Every step of the game, the following transitions happen to each cell simultaneously:
1) Any live cell with exactly 2 or 3 live neighbours survives the step.
2) Any live cell not satisfying condition 1 becomes dead.
3) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

Aside from those, a few additional rules not present in a typical simulation of Conway's Game of Life are also present in the Dandelifeon procedures, listed in the following pages.

All cells have an age; cells not created by the Dandelifeon start at zero. Whenever a cell survives a step, its age increases by one. Whenever a dead cell becomes a live cell, the age of the new live cell becomes the age of its oldest neighbour, plus one, capped at 100.

The 3x3 zone centered around the Dandelifeon itself will absorb all cells that would otherwise generate in the area, converting them into (a frankly ludicrous amount of) Mana. The older the cell that would be created, the more Mana it yields. Age-zero cells produce no Mana.

Whenever any live cells are absorbed by the 3x3 zone in the center, all other cells in the board die.
Additionally, any cell within the range of two or more Dandelifeon flowers dies.

Cellular Blocks are crafted with Cactus, Carrots, Potatoes, and Beetroots, and are extremely fragile. They won't yield anything when broken, nor can they be moved by Pistons. They won't be generated by a Dandelifeon on any cell that doesn't contain air.
However, when not within the range of a Dandelifeon they hold no other special properties.

If a nearby monster is targeted by and hit with a Shulker's projectile, and the Shulk Me Not's internal buffer is empty, both mob and Shulker will be killed, generating ludicrous amounts of Mana from the process.

A few extra points should be made:
Both entities' experience and loot are lost, and both entities must be within the flower's range.

"Enchanting with Mana" "manaEnchanting"
#<<EOF
With the magical power emitted from Mana Pylons, a structure can be built that performs enchants with books without consuming them. The construction of a Mana Enchanter isn't cheap, though, neither in space nor materials.

A Mana Enchanter takes up an area around 11x7 in size, and is constructed from 17 Obsidian blocks, 10 Mystical Flowers of any color or their Glimmering or Floating variants, 6 Mana Pylons, and one Lapis Lazuli Block.
Instructions on assembling this marvelous contraption follow.

After construction, right-click the core lapis block with a Wand of the Forest to activate the enchanter.
To use the enchanter, place (via right-click) the item to be enchanted in the enchanter itself and drop Enchanted Books with the desired enchantments within the obsidian circle. Note that pre-enchanted items can't be placed in the enchanter.

To start the enchantment, right-click the enchanter with a Wand of the Forest. Once it's finished scanning nearby books, a spell circle will appear around the core, indicating that the books can be safely picked up again. Note that the scan will only pick up the first enchantment on a given book; multiple enchantments from one book will not be applied.

The enchanter requires Mana during the enchantment process.
Mana can be fed with Mana Bursts or with a Spark over the enchanter's core (the latter way working much faster).

When the Enchanter has received enough Mana, the enchanting process will wrap itself up, and the enchantments will be applied to the item.
The amount of Mana required depends on the number of enchantments to be applied, and on their respective raritites and levels.

During the enchanting process, the item being enchanted can't be removed.
Additionally, if any component of the construct is removed at any point of the process, the core will revert to its original Lapis Lazuli Block form, and all mana transferred will be lost.

"Botanical Brewery" "brewery"
#<<EOF
Given the versatility of Mana, its practicality in Potion-making should come as a surprise to nobody. Brews are, simply put, variants on Potions. They're created using Mana as a base, but brewed with other ingredients.
Unlike Potions, Brews have fixed multi-reagent recipes, and each vial brewed will contain multiple doses of product.

The process of creating a Brew requires a Botanical Brewery, Vials, Mana, and (of course) the reagents themselves.
The Mana functions as the solvent and energy source for a Brew and is drawn from Mana Bursts; simply pointing a Mana Spreader at the Brewery will work just fine.
Additionally, partially empty Vials can be topped up with others containing the same Brew in a crafting grid.

Working with a Botanical Brewery is rather simple.
Begin by adding a Vial (with a right-click or a drop) into the brewery. Add all required ingredients in a similar manner. Once a Brew has all necessary reagents, give it a few moments to accept the requisite Mana, and it should automatically drop into your inventory.

A simple brew, mimicking a Potion of Swiftness. When quaffed, it gives its drinker a Speed II effect.

"Brew Incenses" "incense"

Brews can provide a great variety of effects when in liquid form. However, their effects don't last long, and Vials take up inventory space besides. Using Incense Sticks instead of containers can mitigate these problems. Sticks are infusable with Brew effects, just like containers, but take around ten times as much Mana to do so.

An Incense Stick can be placed on an Incense Plate by right-clicking on the latter with the former, and a simple click with a Flint and Steel will light it up. Once lit, a stick can not be retrieved.
A single stick of incense will burn for sixty times as long as its liquid counterpart before needing to be replaced.

Incense Plates that are burning Incense Sticks will provide the effects of the Brew infused in the stick to any players in a 30-block radius of the plate.
Not all Brews can be infused into Incense Sticks; for example, Instant Health or Absorption sticks won't brew, nor will any brews with more than one effect.

For incense lovers who're also automation junkies, the Incense Plate can receive items through Hoppers or other inputs. It'll output a Comparator signal of 1 when it has a stick and 2 when it's burning it, and if a Mana Burst with a Kindle Lens hits a plate with an unlit stick, it'll light it.

As its name suggests, the Crafty Crate is a counterpart to the Open Crate, but with the ability to assemble items into other items as a Crafting Table would.
Like a Crafting Table, it has a 9-slot inventory, which can be filled with items in the shape of a crafting recipe.

Item slots are filled from left to right and top to bottom (as illustrated later). The Crafting Placeholder, when input to the Crate, corresponds to an empty slot in a crafting table. This is used to allow for recipes with gaps (e.g. furnace, chest, pickaxe...) to be craftable as well.

Finalizing a recipe can be done in two ways:
Filling all 9 slots with either recipe components or placeholders will instantly try to craft and output the result, as well as any placeholders and/or leftovers remaining in the crafting grid (e.g. buckets when making cake).
Note that the crate will not eject its contents if no recipe is possible.

Right-clicking the crate with a Wand of the Forest (remember: Dispensers can do this) will also attempt a craft and eject the crate's contents afterward.
If a crafting operation attempted this way fails, all inside items are simply ejected with no crafting procedure done.

Attaching a Comparator to a crate will have it emit a signal strength equivalent to the number of items inside the crate.

The Crafty Crate can also be augmented with patterns. A pattern locks specific slots in the recipe, disallowing items from entering those slots as if there were placeholders there.
There are several patterns, each of which can be applied by right-clicking on the crate (this doesn't consume the pattern).

"Hovering Hourglass" "hourglass"
#<<EOF
The ability to keep time is an essential one for anyone who wishes to build any redstone-y contraptions. A classical timer, however, can take up frankly unfortunate amounts of space, to say nothing about efficiency. The Hovering Hourglass is a simple, precise, sand-based timer. As its name implies, it's a hourglass that hovers and turns by itself.

The hourglass can hold up to one stack of either Sand, Red Sand or Soul Sand, added via right-click. Right-clicking a filled hourglass removes its sand. Once sand is added, it'll start draining from one of the chambers into the other. Once the sand finishes draining, the hourglass emits one redstone pulse and flips, restarting the process.

The amount of time between pulses is dependent on the type and quantity of sand in the chamber. Sand falls at a rate of for one second per block, Red Sand ten seconds per, and Soul Sand one minute per. Sand types can't be mixed; the current time between pulses can be seen by holding a Wand of the Forest over the Hourglass.

Note that sand can't be added incrementally by hand, so the size of the sand stack should be adjusted in-inventory.
The sand in the hourglass can, however, be adjusted by Hoppers or similar means.

Right-clicking an hourglass with a Wand of the Forest locks (or unlocks) it. When locked, sand can't be added or removed from an hourglass (just in case someone right-clicks the hourglass on accident).
If a Mana Burst collides with an hourglass, it'll stem the flow of sand and pause the timer; another burst will continue the timer.

Mana Powder can be used in lieu of sand; doing this turns an hourglass from a timer into a counter.
Instead of sand flowing over time, the hourglass will drop one unit of powder every time a Mana Burst collides with it. For example, ten pieces of powder in an hourglass will require 10 Mana Bursts for a redstone pulse.

A cocoon is a symbol of change, of evolution.
A Cocoon of Caprice, when placed, will slowly evolve the rudimentary bits of life inside into a Baby Animal. More often than not, the cocoon will hatch into a farm animal, but on rare occasions, different animals such as Wolves or Horses can be created.

A cocoon near water seems to create aquatic animals instead.
Rumor has it that giving a cocoon Emeralds, Chorus Fruit, or a certain otherworldly essence will influence its outcome towards something... different. What such experiments would yield is anyone's guess, really.
(Giving a cocoon an item can be done via right-click or by simply tossing the item.)

Carving some Livingwood into a humanoid and giving it a Mana Diamond for a heart yields an apparatus known as the Livingwood Avatar. By itself, the block is just a pretty face; however, giving it a Rod enables it to cast magic. At the cost of Mana, from a spreader, of course.

Not all Rods can be used by an avatar. Any that do, however, are detailed in this book.

Applying a redstone signal to the avatar will prevent it from casting.

"Animated Torch" "animatedTorch"
#<<EOF
The Animated Torch is simply a Redstone Torch with a spark of magical autonomy. And the ability to hover.
The torch will point horizontally when placed, providing a redstone signal in that direction and no other. Sneak-right clicking the torch will rotate it 90 degrees, pointing the signal in the new direction instead.

By default, the torch is in Toggle mode: whenever the torch is actuated (by either a Mana Burst or an adjacent Hovering Hourglass), it'll turn 180 degrees, serving as a T flip-flop.

Using a Wand of the Forest on the torch changes its mode. The default mode is Toggle, as previously stated; the other two modes are Rotate, in which the torch rotates 90 degrees each actuation, and Random, in which the torch points randomly each actuation.

"Mana Blaster" "manaBlaster"
#<<EOF
The Mana Blaster simply fires Mana Bursts. While shaped like a pistol for easy handling, it's not so much a firearm as it is a portable Mana Spreader.
By drawing Mana from Mana-carrying items in the holder's inventory, it fires mana bursts from the wielder's current position and bearing.

These bursts differ slightly from the ones fired from spreaders: they travel faster, but carry only three-quarters of the Mana a spreader's burst would. The blaster also has a short cooldown after firing before it can shoot again.

Mana Lenses function in conjunction with the blaster. To attach one to a blaster, craft them together in a crafting table; to remove the lens, simply place the Mana Blaster back on the crafting grid.
A Haste effect on a wielder decreases their blaster's cooldown time.

Watching the slow grow of Grass is seldom a fun activity. Tall Grass, infused with Mana, becomes Pasture Seeds, which will grow grass in a nearby area when used on a Dirt block.
Other dirt-type blocks can also be grown, such as Podzol or Mycelium, from alternative seeds.

An additional six types of Pasture Seeds can be created, for alternative grasslike blocks with various textures.
These spread to dirt like normal and can sustain any plant a block of grass can. Similarly, they may only be picked up with Silk Touch. However, these blocks don't decay back into dirt if covered.

This rod can be given to a Livingwood Avatar; an avatar holding this rod will periodically use its own Mana to place a block of Dirt before itself.

"Rod of the Terra Firma" "terraformRod"
#<<EOF
While digging away at dirt with a shovel is definitely a functional means of landscaping, flattening huge tracts of land can get somewhat arduous.
The Rod of the Terra Firma, by contrast, terraforms in a quicker and environmentally-friendlier manner.

This rod, will, at a nontrivial cost of Mana from the user's inventory, flatten surrounding land to your own altitude. For this to happen, charge it by holding right-click, and slowly but surely, the nearby terrain will be flattened to your level, either by placing Dirt or by removing blocks.

Blocks removed by the rod are non-recoverable.
The terrain will adapt to the changes as best as it can (up to a distance limit) to avoid weirdly-shaped hills and so on. The flattening, thus, will follow the terrain's natural shape.
Note that the rod will completely cease to function below sea level.

"Manasteel Equipment" "manaGear"

Manasteel, like other metals, can be shaped into tools and armor alike.
Tools or armor crafted from this material will share most of their qualities with Iron, albeit with superior enchantability and durability. Additionally, all Manasteel items can heal their durabilities with Mana from their user's inventory (e.g. in a Mana Tablet).

Some Manasteel tools perform special actions when right-clicked: the Pickaxe will place a torch from the user's inventory, and the Axe will do the same with a sapling.
Do note that Shears made of mana-based materials will trigger tripwires, unlike iron ones.

"Terra Blade" "terraSword"
#<<EOF
The Terra Blade, crafted from Terrasteel Ingots, is a sword infused with the strength of nature.

Additionally, it can use Mana for durability, much like Manasteel Tools can.
EOF
)

(
"Terra Shatterer" "terraPick"
#<<EOF
The Terra Shatterer is a tool that, thanks to the sheer quantity of Terrasteel in its recipe, can absorb absolutely ludicrous amounts of Mana.
The tool functions very much like a Mana Tablet when tossed on a Mana Pool. However, any Mana absorbed can't be released again, so it's nonviable as a storage device.

The amount of Mana stored in the tool establishes its Rank. Ranks progress as follows: D, C, B, A, S, and SS, with D being the lowest rank and SS the highest.
The amount of Mana required to advance from rank to rank increases exponentially as the rank does. To advance from D to C, for starters, a Shatterer requires just a few seconds of exposure to a Mana Pool.

To advance from rank C to rank B, a full Mana Pool is required, and the cost increases tenfold for each rank thereafter up to SS.
The rank of the tool does not change its speed; rather, it increases the range of its Active Ability.
A right-click will toggle the Shatterer's Ability on or off.

When the Shatterer's Ability is active, it can break many blocks in a wide surface area at once. At rank C, it breaks a narrow column of blocks; at rank B, it increases to a square, and surface areas increase from there on upward. Note that the rank-D tool does not have an ability. The Shatterer, when active, continuously consumes its internal Mana when not mining.

The tool takes damage for every single block broken, so a decent supply of Mana in the wielder's inventory is a must for higher ranks: the tool will use Mana for durability (like Manasteel Tools do).
Finally, a Shatterer on the ground will never despawn.

(
"Elementium Equipment" "elfGear"
#<<EOF
Similarly to other metals, Elementium can be shaped into tools and armor.
The respective armor components each have decent damage resistances (about half that of diamond armor), as well as the ability to drain Mana to heal damage.

Each piece of armor will, when its bearer is harmed, have a chance to spawn a Pixie to fly after the aggressor, dealing some decent damage.
The more pieces of Elementium Armor equipped, the higher the chance becomes. Additionally, each of the tools in the set comes with its own unique ability.

First, the Elementium Pickaxe will clear away Cobblestone, Dirt, Netherrack, and other common materials, leaving behind only ores and fine resources.
Combining the Elementium Pickaxe with a Terra Shatterer in a crafting square allows for the latter to take on the former's power. This can't be undone.

The Elementium Shovel will, if the block broken is affected by gravity (Gravel, Sand, etc), also destroy all blocks of that material above/below it. No more gravel falling while mining!

The Elementium Axe doubles as a weapon. If used to strike the finishing blow to a Zombie, Skeleton, Creeper, or another Player, it might decapitate its victim, leaving a severed head or skull behind.

The Elementium Hoe will instantly moisten farmland it creates, regardless of proximity to water, or whether water can even exist in the vicinity. Perfect for impatient farmers!

The Elementium Shears can, when drawn back like a bow, speedily shear nearby sheep within a large area of effect centered on the holder.

Finally, the Elementium Sword, when held, increases the chance of a Pixie spawning when hit (this holds true even when no Elementium Armor is worn), and augments the strength of any Pixies spawned.

This bridge can extend up to a hundred blocks away, and will vanish after about thirty seconds.
Only one bridge can be created for any given Rod of the Bifrost at a time; as soon as the old bridge vanishes, a new one can be created.

Identical ores will glow identical colors, though colors may not be the same over separate uses.

The Rod of the Shifting Crust is a magical device with the ability to swap blocks in the world at very high speeds. To set up the rod, sneak-right click a block to select it.
After a block is selected, punching any other block in the world with the rod will use Mana to swap it for the selected block (assuming the latter is present in the user's inventory).

Right-clicking a block in the world will perform a larger transformation, swapping all highlighted blocks with the selected one. Blocks being placed (obviously) come from the user's inventory, and require Mana for placement. Only proper, full-sized blocks can be used for this swap-- no flowers, torches, or other shenanigans of that sort, though slabs are fine.
Very hard blocks may consume more Mana to be replaced.

Other rods or devices can supply blocks to the Rod of the Shifting Crust.
For example, a Rod of the Lands in a user's inventory will provide their Rod of the Shifting Crust with an endless supply of Dirt (assuming sufficient Mana to conjure each dirt block, of course).

To retrieve a Force Relay, sneak-right click it, or use a Dispenser on it, with a Wand of the Forest; any other attempts to retrieve it (including Silk Touch) will destroy it.
Furthermore, this block is highly unstable, and may create uncanny effects; care should be taken with it. It ignores pushes and pulls from Sticky Pistons entirely, allowing for the building of piston "frames."

Those Endermen. They're the peskiest things since Creepers. (I swear, whoever came up with those things really needs to take it down a notch.)
However, a dagger crafted from a material with their energies can tear through them like a thousand-degree knife through butter.

Due to the concentration of energy, though, the dagger's only good for a few kills, and its compactness prevents the Manasteel in its recipe from healing with Mana, the way typical tools would. Still, killing those elongated thieves is worth the trouble.

"Life Imbuer" "spawnerClaw"

Monster Spawners are strange devices. They hold the ability to create life from thin air, but only when someone's nearby to witness their action.
Thus, anyone wishing to exploit one of these oddities ends up tethered by necessity to the surrounding area.

A Life Imbuer is an alternative: when placed over a Monster Spawner, it'll use Mana (fed from a Spreader) to induce spawning in the absence of players.

"Red String" "redString"
#<<EOF
Lore of old says that the gods connect people who will affect each others' lives with a red string, tied between their ankles. While blocks aren't people, they don't need gods to be connected. Instead, they can be linked with a material called (of course) Red String. Blocks created with this exquisite material can face in all 6 directions, and will tie themselves to the nearest compatible block that they're facing.

Each Red Stringed block has a different criterion for what it'll bind to, but all have a range of about eight blocks. If a block is bound, its String can be viewed by holding a Wand of the Forest.
The Red String won't be affected by intervening blocks, but Red Stringed blocks can't be chained.

The Red Stringed Container will bind to inventories (Chests, Furnaces, Hoppers, and so on). Items inserted into a Container (from Hoppers, etc.) will end up in the block it's bound to. Sidedness is preserved: for example, items inserted into the Red Stringed Container from the top will be pushed into the bound block from above, and so on.

The Red Stringed Dispenser binds itself to Dispensers or Droppers, and sends items the same way the Red Stringed Container does. Additionally, when it receives a redstone signal, its bound Dispenser or Dropper will fire.

The Red Stringed Nutrifier can be bound to any block that accepts Bone Meal. Using Bone Meal on the Nutrifier will fertilize its bound block instead.

The Red Stringed Comparator can be bound to any block whose status can be read with a Comparator (e.g. Chests, Mana Pools, Runic Altars, etc). A Comparator attached to this block will output a signal equal to the one it would read from the bound block.

The Red Stringed Spoofer binds to flowers or mushrooms. It requires a Generating or Functional Flower placed atop it to function; the flower placed on it will become inert, and the bound plant will take on all of that flower's properties, acting as if it were the flower itself.

Finally, the Red Stringed Interceptor will bind to any sufficiently complex block (rule of thumb: any block that either moves or accepts/manipulates items should be complex enough). Whenever the block it's bound to is right-clicked by a player, the Interceptor will emit a redstone pulse.

"Flügel Tiara" "flightTiara"
#<<EOF
The Flügel were a race of god-slaying beings that once dominated these lands and possessed powers of three-dimensional flight.
Among other things.
While the Flügel are now quite extinct, the Flügel Tiara, fashioned from Gaia Spirits, can use Mana to replicate their power of flight.

This marvelous reproduction of ancient artifice isn't perfect, though: the tiara can't provide the power of flight indefinitely. If used for around thirty seconds consecutively, it'll "overload" and lose its ability to sustain flight.
A "flight bar" is displayed on the HUD to monitor this usage.

In addition to simple flight, the tiara grants its wearer the ability to dash and glide. Dashing, by pressing [CTRL] without already sprinting, will boost its wearer forwards. Very quickly.
Dashes can only be done every 2 seconds.

Gliding allows for a gentle descent to the ground that covers a decent horizontal distance as well, preventing fall damage in the process. To glide, simply sneak while falling.
Gliding can be done even on an empty flight bar, but will slow its regeneration.

Combining the Flügel Tiara with different types of Quartz will change the appearance of its wings: one style for each type of quartz.
The recipes for the various types of quartz can be found under Decorative Blocks, and the Elves will trade Elven Quartz for Nether Quartz.

"Basics of Corporea" "corporea"
#<<EOF
The Corporea system uses the energy of the End, and the void between worlds, to transport items from point A to point B instantly without intervening blocks.
The system, at its core, uses variant Sparks (called Corporea Sparks) that transport items instead of Mana.

A few things to know: Corporea Sparks are placed over Inventories (like a Chest or Dispenser), as opposed to Mana Containers. There are two types of Corporea Sparks: the plain old Corporea Spark, and the Master Corporea Spark. These Sparks work in networks: each Corporea Network needs one Master Corporea Spark, but any spark can communicate with any other in the network.

When a Corporea Spark is placed or right-clicked, each spark in the network will connect (or reconnect) to nearby sparks, adding them to the network (as long as a Master Corporea Spark is somewhere in the network). While each individual spark's connection range is only around eight blocks, the entire spark network can go for a virtually infinite distance.

A Corporea Spark can see the inventory directly beneath it, but can only access items from its top side. Each Corporea Spark can see the items of every other spark in the network, and certain blocks can use their Sparks to request items from the network.

The Master Corporea Spark, unfortunately, is too busy managing the network to see its own inventory.
Furthermore, Corporea Sparks can't push items into their respective inventories; those should be added through means like Hoppers.

Like normal Sparks, Corporea Sparks can be dyed with Dye; the little star icon floating around the spark shows its current color. Corporea Sparks of different colors won't interact. Thus, multiple independent Networks can be in an area without interacting.

Visualizing a Network and removing a spark from a container are performed the same way they are on ordinary Sparks.
Note that having two Master Corporea Sparks in the same network is a bad idea and can cause undefined behavior.

"Corporea Decor" "corporeaBlock"
#<<EOF
Ordinary Livingrock Bricks can be combined with a Corporea Spark to produce some decorative blocks. These blocks, besides their uses for decoration, have the unique property that they can support Corporea Sparks above themselves, even though they have no inventory. Thus, they can be used as a cheap, lag-free way to extend your Corporea networks over long distances.

(
"Corporea Index" "corporeaIndex"
#<<EOF
One of the most convenient applications of a Corporea Network is that items can be requested verbally by name. The Corporea Index is an Ender Crystal-like block that interfaces with the Corporea Network that its Corporea Spark is connected to.
Approaching one of these will activate it; it shows its radius of effect when active.

While activated, the index will intercept Chat Messages from nearby players, processing them into requests and preventing them from being broadcasted to chat. Each request will attempt to pull from the network items whose names match the chat message; for example, saying "iron ingot" will make the Index search the network for a single Iron Ingot and, if found, manifest it as a dropped item.

Requests can be quantified: for example, requesting "10 apples" will pull up to 10 Apples at once. The word "this" will be interpreted as the item currently in the user's hand. Prepending or appending any of "...", "~", "+" or "?" to a query will request items whose names contain the query instead: for example, "iron..." could return any item with "iron" in its name.

A "*" anywhere in the string represents any number of characters; for example, querying for "Nethe*ck" could return some Netherrack, a Nether Brick, or even an item renamed "Netheck".
Note that requesting "*iron*" is equivalent to requesting "iron...", and that requesting "*" could return anything.

The Index can only understand simple plurals (those suffixed by "-s", "-es" or "-ies"), but will accept the singular even when requesting multiple items (it'll understand "10 apple" properly).
"10 of this" requests 10 items whose names match the held item's, as one might expect.

Quantifiers on plurals are possible: any of "a stack of apples", "2 stacks of apples", "2 stacks and 20 apples", "half a stack of apples", or "a dozen apples" will be understood.
The index can handle requests of varying verbosity; "2x stacks and 20x of apples", "2 stack 2 apple", and "2 stacks + 2 apples" are all processed the same way.

The words "all" or "every" request every single item in the network matching the given criteria; for example, "all apples" will retrieve every single apple (as well as every item renamed to "apple") in the network.
The words "count", "show", "display" and "tell" won't retrieve any items, but will count them for the requester's convenience.

When next to a Corporea Index and viewing an inventory (or a recipe), pressing [c] while hovering over an item will request a copy of that item.
Holding SHIFT while doing so will request a full stack of the item, holding CTRL will request half a stack, and holding both will request a quarter-stack.

"Corporea Funnel" "corporeaFunnel"
#<<EOF
A block that uses the Corporea Network more simply than the Index is the Corporea Funnel. When given a redstone signal, it'll request an item from the network of the Corporea Spark above it.
Said item will be pushed into an inventory a block or two below the funnel, or just dropped into the world above the Funnel if no such inventory is available.

To tell the Corporea Funnel what to request, place the item in an Item Frame on the block; if more than one Item Frame is on the block, the Corporea Funnel will pick one at random.
Rotating the item in the frame will change the request quantity; at default rotation the funnel will request one item, and rotations will respectively make the funnel request 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 48, and 64 items.

(
"Corporea Interceptor" "corporeaInterceptor"
#<<EOF
The Corporea Interceptor does exactly as its name suggests: it intercepts unfulfillable Corporea requests for specific items. (items in Item Frames attached to the block designate which items it'll recognize).

When a request is made for an item that the network can't provide, but that the Interceptor recognizes, the Interceptor will trigger and emit a short redstone pulse. This can be used to do all sorts of things: for example, craft the requisite item with a Crafty Crate, or light up a lamp indicating that the resource is out.

"Corporea Crystal Cube" "corporeaCrystalCube"
#<<EOF
A seer usually looks through a crystal ball to see the future. Well, a Corporea handler can look through a crystal cube to see the present. The Corporea Crystal Cube is a visual medium for interacting with a Corporea Network.

When the block is given a spark, right-clicking it with an item will make it display how many of that item exist in its spark's network. The display updates itself about once every second.
Punching a Cube will request one of its current item from the network, and sneak-punching it will request a whole stack.

A Redstone Comparator attached to a cube will read the magnitude of the number of items it can find, logarithmically: that is, doubling the items in the network will increase the Comparator's output by one. If the Cube can find no items, the Comparator outputs signal strength 0; 1 item yields strength 1; 2 items for strength 2; 4 for 3; 8 for 4; 16 for 5; and so on, up to an whopping 16384 items needed to output signal strength 15.

Sneak-right clicking a Corporea Crystal Cube with a Wand of the Forest locks or unlocks it. When locked, a Cube's monitored item can't be changed (just in case someone right-clicks it on accident).

(
"Corporea Retainer" "corporeaRetainer"
#<<EOF
The Corporea Retainer is an addon (of sorts) to the Corporea Interceptor. When placed adjacent to an Interceptor, one of these will remember the origin and contents of any requests that trigger the former.

Once the Corporea Retainer memorizes a request, when given a redstone signal it'll "replay" the request, performing it from its original position. For example: consider a Funnel that requests Wooden Planks when there are no more left. An Interceptor in the network could catch the request and trigger a mechanism to craft the missing planks; if an attached Retainer was triggered after that, it would make the original Funnel redo its request and get its planks.

As the Corporea Retainer is an addon to the Interceptor, it can proxy its requests through the latter, so it doesn't need a spark itself.
The retainer can only memorize one request at a time; any additional incoming requests will be discarded rather than stored. A Redstone Comparator can read whether a request is being held, and if so, how many items.

Using a Wand of the Forest on the Retainer will toggle it between remembering the total count of the original request, or only the number of missing items.

Afterwards, another piece will be needed in the event of a second death.

There is, however, one restriction on the items the ivy can protect.
For technical reasons, the ivy will not attach to an item that leaves something behind when used in a crafting recipe (like a Bucket of Water or a Mortar and Pestle).

The Black Hole Talisman utilizes powerful Gaia and Ender magics to store a virtually infinite quantity of a single type of block.

Right-clicking a block with an empty Talisman will set it to store that type of block, and sneak-right clicking the Talisman in the air will enable or disable it. When enabled, a Talisman will absorb any blocks of its given type from its user's inventory.
Placing the item in a crafting grid will yield its stored blocks, a stack at a time.

Any blocks stored in a Talisman can be placed by simply right-clicking with it.
Right-clicking the Talisman on an inventory will dump up to a stack of blocks into that inventory. Finally, a Talisman can provide a Rod of the Shifting Crust with the blocks it contains.

"Luminizer Transport" "luminizerTransport"
#<<EOF
Luminizers simply transport players (and other entities), by flying them through the air on trails of light.
Luminizers are placed in the world as blocks and function when bound to other Luminizers (with a Wand of the Forest). Right-clicking a Luminizer will transport its user to the Luminizer it's bound to.

Luminizers have a range of twenty blocks each, but can be chained together to create quite long and complex paths.
Luminizer bindings are unidirectional unless explicitly bound both ways. Do note, though, that such a binding would create an endless loop.
Multiple Luminizers can bind to the same endpoint.

Adding some Redstone to a Luminizer makes it a Detector Luminizer, which functions just like a regular Luminizer but additionally emits a redstone pulse when something reaches (or passes through) it.

Adding a Lever to a Luminizer turns it into a Toggle Luminizer, which accepts a redstone signal. When powered, a Toggle Luminizer will drop anything passing through; it works normally when unpowered.

A Luminizer and a Redstone Torch yield a Fork Luminizer.
These will react to an Animated Torch placed up to two blocks above or below it; any incoming entities will be sent to a Luminizer in the direction that the Torch is pointing towards.

The Fork Luminizer can still be bound like any other style of Luminizer, but it'll only use its binding if no Animated Torch is available to tell it where to go (or if there aren't any Luminizers in the direction the Torch points).

Players can just right-click a Luminizer to board it, but to get animals, dropped items, or anything into the transports, a Luminizer Launcher is needed. This should be placed adjacent to one or more Luminizers. When a Launcher receives a redstone pulse, it'll send all living things and items on it into the adjacent Luminizer (or a random Luminizer per entity, if more than one is nearby), sending them on their merry ways.

"The Portal to Alfheim" "aIntro"
#<<EOF
They say that once upon a time, Elves shared the world with us Minecraftians. Due to events presently unknown to us, at some point they were banished back to their own world, Alfheim, never to return.
Experiments have been performed in an attempt to re-establish a connection between the two worlds, and a theoretical procedure for creating such a portal has been devised.

Actually creating this portal would prove to be an arduous task: quite a few unusual resources would be necessary. The net requirements come down to 8 Livingwood blocks, 3 Glimmering Livingwood blocks, an Elven Gateway Core (read on), and at least 2 Mana Pools and Natura Pylons (read on).

At least two Mana Pools with Natura Pylons directly above them would be needed within an 11x11x11 area around the Core. The initial activation of the portal, we believe, would cost a huge amount of Mana from said Pools, and would be performed by right-clicking the core with a Wand of the Forest.
The portal is designed to draw Mana from all pools with Pylons equally; if any pool ran out, any connection a portal might have would close.

Even with all these preparations, any link the portal could establish would be too weak to transfer living beings (so an Alfheim vacation's off the table no matter what), but items might just make it through-- though Mana from the surrounding Mana Pools would be needed for items to survive a return trip.

All knowledge about Alfheim in this lexicon is, at this point, limited to what you find in this entry-- it seems that Elven knowledge has been almost totally lost.
Perhaps if the Elves could have a look at this book, they could provide further insight.

"A Message from Elven Garde" "elfMessage"
#<<EOF
Greetings. We found this book when one of our old portal frames spontaneously opened a link to another world-- quite a shock for us indeed. On behalf of all Elven Garde, we thank you sincerely for providing us with a repository of the knowledge from your world. It's been a while since we had to leave, so it's good to see that it's been doing well.

After extensive discussion within the High Council of Elven Garde, we have decided to cooperate with you. You see, your "Lexica Botania" makes references to certain resources from your world that we might be extremely keen to get our hands on-- these resources are simply non-existent in our lands.

The link you've established is, unfortunately, too weak to transfer living beings-- this seems to be a consequence of the sheer distance between our realms. A pity: we would have liked to meet our trading partner in person. However, on the upside, the link allows us to change the synchronization of time across our worlds-- which is how you will receive your book back so quickly, at least from your perspective.

We're well-stocked on Mana and other magical energies, so worry not about the portal closing on our end. In fact, to be blunt, our offer is as follows: for the advancement of both of our civilizations, we vow to provide certain resources you lack in your world, in exchange for certain resources from yours that we lack in ours.

We have taken the liberty of assigning our best scribes to transcribe the bulk of the knowledge from our world into your lexicon. We hope you find it enlightening, and that the knowledge encourages you to invest in our materials.

Please be forewarned that if you do decide to send us an item we have not vowed to trade for, we will assume it to be a gift and keep it for ourselves. We thank you again, and look forward to exchanging resources with you.
Best Regards, the High Council of Elven Garde.

"The Resources of Alfheim" "elfResources"
#<<EOF
Alfheim contains a myriad of valuable resources. Unfortunately, most of them are rather scarce due to competition between the various Elven clans. The Elves you have contacted are interested in trading resources native to their lands, such as Dreamwood, Elementium, Pixie Dust and Dragonstones.

Dreamwood, similarly to Livingwood, can be crafted into various Decorative Blocks (see that entry for the recipes).

The Elves also have their eyes on that white posh-looking material from the Nether, Nether Quartz, as the stuff they have in their world is tinted green. This quartz holds no functional difference to other types of quartz, including normal Nether Quartz and any of its decorative variants.

Alfheim also has its own variant of Glass called Alfglass. It's quite transparent, and its patterning looks different depending on where it's placed.
The elves will trade this for Managlass.

"Ritual of Gaia" "gaiaRitual"
#<<EOF
The Ritual of Gaia is a trial often undertaken by elves. It yields Gaia Spirits, which are coveted as fragments of the power of the Goddess of Gaia herself.
This ritual requires an Active Beacon with Gaia Pylons surrounding it (functioning as an altar), as well as a single Terrasteel Ingot (as a sacrifice).

To start the ritual, simply sneak-right click the Beacon with the Terrasteel Ingot, take a step back, and prepare to fight for your life. Preparation is absolutely required-- the fight with the Guardian of Gaia can be even harder than that with the Wither. Upon the Guardian's defeat, a handful of Spirits of Gaia is dropped as a prize.

Standard gear for this ritual is a set of enchanted Elementium Armor, a Terra Blade, and a miscellany of Brews and Trinkets. Do note that the Beacon's effect is forcibly nullified during the battle.
The Guardian has a massive pool of health, so preparing with Enchantments and Brews is a must!

The difficulty of (and reward yielded by) the ritual depends on the number of people participating. Performing the ritual with over five people in the vicinity can be a recipe for disaster with the chaos created, so rituals on that scale probably shouldn't be attempted.
Lastly, it might be a good idea to stay away from the purple.

"Ritual of Gaia II" "gaiaRitualHardmode"
#<<EOF
One would think that combining two of the most powerful botanical resources known (i.e. Terrasteel and Gaia Spirits) would create a material that would be truly unstoppable. Unfortunately, the reality is that said material is very much stoppable. In fact, the two sets of energies seem to cancel almost perfectly when combined into an ingot, yielding an utterly useless alloy.

This ingot, however, can be sacrificed to a Beacon to summon an even stronger Gaia Guardian-- with more strength, speed, and resistance.
On the other hand, slaying this greater Guardian yields many more Gaia Spirits, as well as a handful of goodies and rare treasure. It's a worthwhile foe.

"The Relics of the Aesir" "relics"
#<<EOF
The high clans of Alfheim have passed down an old legend that roughly translates to "Whosoever rolls a Die of Fate shall be rewarded with a Gift from the Gods". Said gifts, also known as Relics of the Aesir, are said to be soulbound and unique.
But then again, all of this is hearsay-- the Relics are probably just legends.

(
"The Relics of the Aesir II" "relicInfo"
#<<EOF
It appears as if the oft-speculated-about Relics are, in fact, real. These items are materialized from rolls of the Dice of Fate, and possess incredible powers. (The Dice of Fate being six-sided seems to imply the existence of six Relics.)
Relics seem to know who earned them; thus, giving someone a Relic they didn't earn is a bad idea.

The legends say that the same Relic may not be awarded to the same person twice-- so keeping an earned Relic safe is high-priority; perhaps Resolute Ivy would make a good investment.
Interestingly enough, an earned relic will transcribe the knowledge on its use into this lexicon. How convenient.

"The Fruit of Grisaia" "infiniteFruit"
#<<EOF
The relic known as The Fruit of Grisaia bestows the brave soul who earned it with an endless supply of nourishment. It can be eaten like any other piece of food, but will use Mana to replenish hunger instead.
It would probably be a good idea to get used to the taste of apple, though.

"Key of the King's Law" "kingKey"
#<<EOF
The Key of the King's Law is a powerful relic with the ability to materialize weapons from thin air. Holding down right-click with this key will begin summoning glowing projectiles from... somewhere. Up to twenty projectiles can be created at once, and releasing the grip on the key will launch them, one at a time, at the point the summoner is looking towards. These projectiles move at high velocities and explode on contact.

"Eye of the Flügel" "flugelEye"
#<<EOF
Unlike the crafted Flügel Tiara, the Eye of the Flügel contains primordial Flügel magic. Magic strong enough, in fact, to harness the Flügels' ability to recall themselves to a previously-visited location.
Sneak-right clicking this eye somewhere will bind it to that position. Holding right-click with a bound Eye will then use Mana to warp its owner back to its bound location.

Unfortunately, the Eye is still but a fragment of the Flügels' true potential, so it can't warp its user across dimensions.
However, just having an Eye of the Flügel on hand allows a Flügel Tiara user to fly with an empty flight bar (at a higher Mana cost).

"Ring of Thor" "thorRing"

One of the three mythical rings of the Aesir, the Ring of Thor bestows upon its wearer the might of the Thunder God. When equipped, it dramatically increases a Terra Shatterer's area of effect.

)

(
"Ring of Loki" "lokiRing"
#<<EOF
One of the three mythical rings of the Aesir, the Ring of Loki allows for the wearer to call upon the Trickster God's ability to effectively be in multiple places at once.
To use an equipped Ring of Loki, begin by sneak-righting click a block with an empty hand.

Once a block is selected (designated the "origin"), sneak-right clicking other blocks will store their offsets from the origin in the ring. To finish the procedure, sneak-right click the origin again.
Sneak-right clicking a stored block during the selection process will remove it from the ring's memory. To clear a completed selection, just sneak-right click the ground twice.

After the selection is complete, multiple boxes in wireframe will be visible, moving relative to the looked-at block. When a block is placed while sneaking, all wireframe locations will have blocks placed there, too, allowing for placement en masse. The Terra Shatterer and Terra Truncator will also break blocks at these locations when sneaking, allowing for truly ludicrous quantities of destruction.

Such power doesn't come for free, of course. The ring consumes Mana from the user's inventory for each block placed. Note that the larger the current selection, the more expensive each placed block becomes.

"Ring of Odin" "odinRing"

"Elven Lore - The Shattering" "elvenLore"
#<<EOF
This entry appears to be a set of papers torn out of an Elven Garde tome. While it may prove useful for learning about history, it's doubtful that it will provide any insight into the study of botany.

It has been millenia since the event known as The Shattering tore the worlds asunder. Very few know the truth of what happened on that day, and this account seeks to remedy that.

It began when Nidavellir was struck by an earthquake that collapsed the majority of the realm. While the Dwarves' incredible strength and durability allowed them to survive and preserve certain things, most of their technology and culture was lost to the void between worlds.

This disturbance caused Muspelheim to break free from its tether on the World Tree herself. It crashed into the far realm of Midgard, fusing with it in a storm of fire that left no life remaining there. Many of us believe that the goddess Hel had a hand in Muspelheim's fall, but no concrete evidence was ever found.

The quakes managed to reach Jotunheim, cracking the earth and massacring the Giants. We do not know whether they have truly died out, but the Giants have not resurfaced since. Niflheim remained perfectly still, despite Muspelheim's fall-- a major factor in the theories about Hel. However, since it contains no known life besides the goddess herself, we are unworried about any damage incurred there.

We of Alfheim were dealt a great blow, but some worse than others. As the Salamander and Undine clans depend greatly on their respective volcanic and aquatic environments, the disroption of those environments decimated the population. Conversely, the Sylph, being a nomadic clan who preferred the sky to the land, remained largely unscathed. Their cousins the Spriggan, nomads as well, were also able to survive relatively intact.

At that time, we had little true structure to our civilization, living in simple huts of Dreamwood. This made rebuilding little more than a chore of gathering materials, especially as we had prior warning.

Our Sylph emmissary to Asgard, Allewyn, witnessed the beginning of it all: Thor turning Mjölnir upon the Bifrost, shattering it. Her command to evacute our entire Midgardian population saved thousands of lives. Although she seemed outwardly unharmed as she arrived on the crest of a wave of crumbling Bifrost to warn us, the toll of the journey caused her to pass away shortly after.

What concerns us now is the state of Midgard. As the Bifrost can no longer give us access to that world, we cannot observe it directly. However, the Mana left behind as we fled surely has brought about new life, as it always does. Whether it be animal, floral, or fungal, and whether it be natural or magical in nature, we hope that life will be intelligent enough to harness what we left behind.

"Decorative Blocks" "decorativeBlocks"
#<<EOF
Quite apart from functionality, there exist quite a few blocks for the sole purpose of making your builds look better.
Livingrock and Livingwood can be turned into decorative blocks; each material has four different decorative variations on its texture.

Nether Quartz can be combined with a variety of substances to create a wide array of decorative Quartzes.
All of these can be crafted into their block counterparts, the same way Quartz can.

"Dispenser Planting" "dispenserTweaks"
#<<EOF
Botania tweaks Dispensers to be able to plant all kinds of seeds, from your standard wheat Seeds to Nether Warts and Cocoa Beans (the latter requiring a block of Jungle Wood across from the Dispenser).
In conjunction with other blocks (like the Drum of the Wild), this allows for fully-automated crop farming.

"Glimmering Flowers" "shinyFlowers"
#<<EOF
Glowstone Dust can be sprinkled over Mystical Flowers to turn them into Glimmering Flowers, which sparkle bright enough to emit actual light (at the same brightness as Glowstone Block does).
Combining one of these with some Dirt and Pasture Seeds yields a Floating Flower, a miniature floating island that emits light and looks quite fancy indeed.

Crafting a Floating Flower with a Functional or Generating Flower will plant the latter on the former, yielding the looks and properties of a Floating Flower and the effects of the other flower, all rolled into one tiny island. Right-clicking a Floating Flower with Pasture Seeds or a Snowball will change its appearance.

"Tiny Potato" "tinyPotato"
#<<EOF
It's a tiny potato! It believes in you!
No. Really, that's it. A Potato, thrown into a Mana Pool, gains a little spark of life and joy. The Tiny Potato is lively, but patting it with a right-click will make it even more so!
A Potato can also be named in an Anvil.

The potato can be given items (with right-click) to hold; one item per side of the Potato. (Items placed on its bottom face will show up on the lower half of the Potato's front.)
Unfortunately, potatoes aren't exactly known for their dexterity, so some items may look out of place when held. (And that's okay.)

"Head Creation" "headCreating"
#<<EOF
A commonly-invoked spell of the Elves is the use of a few resources and a Name Tag to transmute a piece of Livingrock into the head of the Player named by the tag.
Its exact mechanics are unknown, but the spell seems easy enough to replicate on a Runic Altar.

A subset of the Minecraft community (whoops fourth wall) has dedicated itself to creating heads that serve as all sorts of decorations. Avid decorators might consider visiting some community websites that aggregate these heads.

Having your beautiful skin and accessories hidden under a set of clunky armor is nobody's dream. It's bulky, flat, and worst of all, unfashionable!

"Challenges" "challenges"
#<<EOF
This book contains a multitude of Challenges-- optional quests that challenge the player to create a mechanism from only Botania and Minecraft features.
Of course, you can use items from other mods to complete them, but that's no fun.

All of the challenges are possible, of course. They just require some thinking, ingenuity, and knowledge of the ins and outs of redstone (and Botania itself).
We highly recommended not using features from external mods, as these Challenges aren't really, well, challenging, if you can just place down a block that solves problems instantly.

These challenges aren't obligatory in any way, and do not provide any material reward. They're purely suggestions as to what you can make Botania can do. Challenges should marked "complete" manually.
Keep in mind that the only boundaries in Minecraft are those of your imagination, so don't stop at the ideas in here!

"Cacophonium" "cacophonium"

The Cacophonium is an instrument that can mimic living beings' cries, allowing a "musician" to play sounds of nature at will. Right-clicking with it on an entity saves the sounds it can emit into the Cacophonium. Holding right-click, then, will play back those sounds.
Why anyone would ever want to use this contraption, however, is beyond moral comprehension.

For ultimate chaos, the Cacophonium can be placed in a Note Block with a sneak-right click, giving the block the ability to sound off animal or monster sounds on demand.
You monster.
